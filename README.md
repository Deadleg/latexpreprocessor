For the start of a 3 part adventure, look [http://deadleg.github.io/2015/01/24/the-making-of-a-latex-processor-part-i.html](here).

This project didn't come to much of anything except a partial implementation of markdown, and a method of writing math equations in haskell which can be formatted to latex.
