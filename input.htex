Hello, my name is Deadleg. I intend to turn this into a latex precompiler. Here is a list of reasons why:

- This is fun
- Ye
- OKOK

or if you prefer numbered lists:

-# hello
-# sup
-# goodbye

OR, if you prefer neither, here's a description

-sup hello
-bye goodbye

How about some *italics*? Or **bold**? Or... *_Bold italics_*?
